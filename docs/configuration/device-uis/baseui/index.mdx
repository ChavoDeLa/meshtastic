## What is BaseUI?

BaseUI starts a user's journey with Meshtastic for devices with OLED screens and basic TFTs; it serves as the base or foundation of your experience. BaseUI is a rebuild and rebrand of the interface from the ground up, making it more intuitive, more capable including new standalone features, and easier to use on a wider range of devices.

## Supported Devices

All devices with an OLED and TFT display will support BaseUI

## Installation

BaseUI is by default installed on supported devices using the [Meshtastic Web Flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org). Select a 2.7+ version firmware. Devices that support [MeshtasticUI](./meshtasticui/) (MUI) can enable this with the option to use both UIs on their device; switching is performed their their respective menu systems.

## Initial Setup

## Buttons

BaseUI is designed to be navigated with as little as one button but support a myraid of devices from CardKB, Rotary Encoders, Trackballs, and Rocker Switches.

### Send

#### Ping

Manually announces the device to other nodes on the mesh.

This is optional, as nodes are discovered automatically,
however sending a ping manually may speed up this process is some situations.

#### Canned Messages

Send predefined text messages to the mesh network from the device without using the phone app.
To enable this feature, [set a list of predefined messages](/docs/configuration/module/canned-message/#messages).
No further configuration is required.

To send, select the predefined message in the `Send` menu, then select a destination. The list of possible destinations will include the device's available channels, and nodes marked favorite.

### Options

#### Enable / Disable GPS
